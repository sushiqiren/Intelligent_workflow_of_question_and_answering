Financial planners craft comprehensive financial plans covering retirement, investments, insurance, and estate planning. Their qualifications include a relevant bachelor's degree, ideally in financial planning, along with certification such as CFP or FPA accreditation. On the other hand, financial advisors help in financial matters but with a narrower focus, often specialising in areas like investment management or insurance. Their educational requirement usually involves a bachelor's degree in business with a finance focus. While financial planners typically charge a fee for their services, financial advisors might charge a commission or fee.
